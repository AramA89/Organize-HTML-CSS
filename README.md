# Organize HTML & CSS Semantic Code

## Description
There were two pages of starter code given. I needed to go over the code and decide if anyof the code needed change or modification. After review of the code, they were in need of more structure and organization. 
### Challenge Types 

The two types of Challenges are the following:

* Add more structure and cohesivness to **HTML** code.

* Too many repetitive lines in **CSS** code.
### Challenge Elements

Each Challenge contains the following elements:

* **User Story**: 
```

As a new student to coding I want to do my best, to be able to meet industry standards. I was able to review the code and see there were many things to modify. There was a link in the header that was not working. The body also had very little structure, and was seperated with divisions, instead of proper sub categories. Also, the **CSS** code had many lines that I was able to group together. This process made for a more structured and presentable format. 
```

* **Acceptance Criteria**: 
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
## Submission
* Application deployed at live URL.
* Application GitHub URL submitted.
* GitHub repository contains application code.
* The URL of the deployed application.
